                This part of the web application is designed to show case important documentation
                that was used in creating some to the application you will see later in the projects
                section. It currently contains 2 important parts, <strong>Programming Languages</strong> which is a list
                of programming languages used to build the application show-cased in this website and
                <strong>Web Technologies</strong> which are the tools designed to be short-cuts to the development
                process.

                Microsoft's most popular programming computer technology known as <strong>.Net</strong> comes with the
                C# programming language, pronoused <strong><em>C Sharp</em></strong> and is a general purpose programming language
                which is also considered by many as a multiparadigm programming language. This allows users to utilise programming techniques
                such as <strong>Object Oriented Programmin language</strong>, <strong>Strong typing </strong> "an empasis on the
                rules used during compile time" <strong>Imperitive</strong> "statements that change a programs state"
                and finally <strong>Declarative</strong> "the ability to build the structure of computer programs without expressing
                the logical flow"
